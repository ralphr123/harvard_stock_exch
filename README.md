# project2
This is a project I completed while at the three week summer course on Web Development in Harvard University. 

The site is a game where one can simulate buying shares in the stock market with fake money and viewing their results based on 
the actual stocks in real time. 

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. I used Python with Flask for the backend. All the work was done on the CS50 IDE.
