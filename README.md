# project2
This is a project I completed while at the three week summer course on Web Development in Harvard University. 

The site is a game to simulate buying shares in the stock market with fake money and viewing their results based on 
the actual stocks. 

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. I used Python with Flask for the backend. All the work was done on the CS50 IDE. 

If I were to redo this project, I would comment my code.

This project is currently not hosted anywhere but the source code is available.
