# project2
This is a project I completed while at the three week summer course on Web Development in Harvard University. 

The site is a game where one can simulate buying shares in the stock market with fake money and viewing their results based on 
the actual stocks in real time. 

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. I used Python with Flask for the backend. All the work was done on the CS50 IDE. 

At the time, I was mainly focused on finishing the project and putting my best effort into the code! If I were to redo this project, I would include more comments along the way to explain my decisions and guide fresh eyes through the structure of the program. 

This website is currently not hosted anywhere but the source code is available.
